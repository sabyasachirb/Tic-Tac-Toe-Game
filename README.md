# This is my Tic-Tac-Toe Game Repository
</br>
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implementation in JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid, checks for a winner or a draw, and provides options to reset the game or start a new game. </br>
The game logic is handled through event listeners on the grid buttons and functions to check for winning patterns and draw conditions.</br>
The user interface is updated dynamically based on the game state.</br>
Overall, it provides a basic but functional Tic Tac Toe experience in a web environment.</br>
Enjoy playing!</br>
